## AutoRestart
Simple AutoRestart plugin easily configurable.

# Features
- Fallback server
    - Fallback server can be provided in the config.yml, so when the timer reaches 5 seconds left it'll attempt to send all online players to that fallback
- Data
  - All existing worlds will get saved just before the players get sent to the fallback.
- Broadcast
  - When there is 60 seconds left the broadcast will start.
- Command
  - The command `/ar` will give the time until the next server restart.

# Updates
Likely not going to update this as it's just a simple restart plugin. Unless I see something which can be changed or added this will be the only commit.
